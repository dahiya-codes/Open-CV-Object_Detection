# OpenCV Face Detection

This project demonstrates face and eye detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers.

## Features

- Detects faces from video input using Haar Cascade face classifier.
- Further detects eyes from the detected faces using Haar Cascade eye classifier.

## Scope and Applications
- Basic demonstration of face and eye detection using OpenCV.
- Suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex computer vision projects.
- Applications include building college ID systems, real-time monitoring systems, etc.
